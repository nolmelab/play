# coding style 

## naming 

- snake case everywhere like boost or standard library. 
    - classes, structs, types, enums 
    - file names 
    - except 
        - macros 
        - template parameter types
    - start PLAY_ for macros

- formatting of source code
    - class
        - public, protected, private sections
        - types, funtions, variables order
    - open a brace at next line 
    - if, while, switch have braces
    - look at boost.beast 
        - comment style 
        - formatting (slightly different)
    
- c++20 
    - use more recent standard if available
    - try to find an learn recent approaches

## principles 

- clarity 
- easiness
- playness (i.e, stability)
- testability 
- debuggability 

- use (good) libraries if available
